This gem provides a client library for working with the Open Integration Gateway
provided by Mitel phone systems. The library makes use of both the SOAP and REST
interfaces to try to expose as much of the available functionality as possible.
The library maintains a Ruby-oriented way of interacting with the OIG services
by exposing simple objects that represent and permit interaction with various
elements of the OIG services.
